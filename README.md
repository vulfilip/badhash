# badhash
An intentionally bad, absolutely awful, crackable, unsecure "hashing" algorithm.
# What is this?
This is an algorithm which can't even be called "hashing" algorithm because of how bad it is. The purpose of this is finding the original password (the string inside the variable "original").

Based on the result hash which is provided here:
```
ODg4O2m3606i57h9h83ki99ik70518285l44kmhh611lij0k6h669m1m2l0015mii7338TI2NDEzOTk2NzYzNTE1MTM4MTEwMTQ2f3606b57a9a83db99bd70518285e44dfaa611ebc0d6a669f1f2e0015fbb73380NA
```
And based on the code provided in ![Bad Algorithm](https://github.com/vulfilip/badhash/blob/main/badalgorithm.rs) file, find a way to reverse engineer this bunch of nonsense into the original password.
If you successfully solved this little challenge, DM me on discord ( Vulfilip#6855 ) and I will make sure to put your name, or github link if you prefer so, in the below section.
